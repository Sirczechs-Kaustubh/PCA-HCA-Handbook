## Description
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that serves as a handbook for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA). The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to applying these techniques on the Iris dataset from sklearn.

## Introduction
The notebook provides a guide to performing PCA and HCA using Pandas and SKlearn in Python. These are two unsupervised machine learning techniques for dimensionality reduction and data exploration.

## Dataset
The notebook uses the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of four features of three species of iris flowers. The dataset can be read into a Pandas dataframe using the `read_csv()` function or the `datasets.load_iris()` function from SKlearn.

## PCA
The notebook starts with the PCA section, which consists of several tasks. The first task is to import the dataset and explore it using Pandas and Matplotlib functions. The second task is to standardize the data and apply PCA using the `StandardScaler()` and `PCA()` classes from SKlearn. The third task is to plot the principal components and interpret the results. The fourth task is to apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data and compare the performance of a logistic regression classifier on the original and reduced data.

## HCA
The notebook also includes a section on HCA, explaining how to apply HCA using SKlearn, how to interpret the dendrogram, and how to use HCA for clustering or anomaly detection.

## Conclusion
The notebook concludes with a summary of the main findings and implications of the analysis, and suggests directions for future research or applications.
